## About

Dischord aims to provide a simple, yet powerful and revolutionary [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) library to interact with the [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).

_⚠️This project is currently in development and there is no ETA for a release._


## TODO
- [ ] Decide whether to use JavaScript or TypeScript for development
- [ ] Plan an organized structure for the library
- [ ] Decide which libraries to use (voice, rest, etc.)
- [ ] Decide which additional libraries to use (testing, linting, etc.)
